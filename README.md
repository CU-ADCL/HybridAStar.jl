# HybridAStar.jl

This is a Julia package for using the Hybrid A* algorithm.

## Information on Hybrid A* algorithm can be found in these papers

* Junior: The Stanford entry in the Urban Challenge [(Link)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rob.20258)
* Application of Hybrid A* to an Autonomous Mobile Robot for Path Planning in Unstructured Outdoor Environments [(Link)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6309512)

## This package provides users with these two functions:

* **hybrid_astar_search** : used to generate the control sequence that can guide the
* **get_path** : used to obtain the points along the path 

### 1) hybrid_astar_search

  Input parameters:
  * node
  * goal
  * dasd

  Output: 

### 2) get_path

  Input parameters:
  *sds
  *fsdf

  Output:


Here is a simple 


A more complex example to find a drivable path for a Dubin's car using the Hybrid A* algorithm can be found in the examples folder.
