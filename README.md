#HybridAStar.jl

##Julia package for using the Hybrid A* algorithm

###Information on Hybrid A* algorithm can be found in these papers

* Junior: The Stanford entry in the Urban Challenge [(Link)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rob.20258)
* Application of Hybrid A* to an Autonomous Mobile Robot for Path Planning in Unstructured Outdoor Environments [(Link)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6309512)


This package provides users with these two functions:

* **hybrid_astar_search** : used to generate the control sequence that can guide the
* **get_path** : used to obtain the points along the path
